### Presenting Myself
I am a graduate data scientist and political scientist based in Montreal. 

I completed my undergraduate degree at McGill University, where I studied political science, history, and Russian. I was awarded the Guy Drummond Fellowship to start my Masters at McGill and spend a year studying at Sciences Po Paris. The fellowship is awarded to the top two graduating students in the political science department. I now work as a research assistant at <a href="http://www.aaronerlich.com/demotip-laboratory"> DemoTIP Lab</a>, where I mostly perform data science, and I am a member of the <a href="https://csdc-cecd.ca/"> Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship</a>. My research interests are Canadian politics, Middle-Eastern and Post-Soviet area studies, transparency, disinformation, and conspiracies. 

I am based in Montreal, where I have previously worked at various jobs in the restaurant industry. In my free time I like DJing, snowboarding, frisbee, camping, cooking, travelling, and working on my data visualization skills. <a href="/data-science"> Check out my data science projects and cool visualizations </a>.
