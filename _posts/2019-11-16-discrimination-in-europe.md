I am working on a project right now for a class at Sciences Po about discrimination. I figured I could look at how people have perceived being discriminated against over time using each round of the European Social Survey and practice my animation and visualization skills. I was really happy with [ggthemr](https://github.com/cttobin/ggthemr) who came through with the beautiful *"flat dark"* to match the website theme. 

I decided to plot the proportion of ethnic minorities who feel discriminated against in their country for France and England over time. The plots animate over time, and over different forms of discrimination. Bars represent 95% confidence intervals. 

| Round | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
